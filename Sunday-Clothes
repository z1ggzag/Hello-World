#"Put On Your Sunday Clothes"

[Cornelius:]
Out there
There's a world outside of Yonkers
Way out there beyond this hick town, Barnaby
There's a slick town, Barnaby
Out there
Full of shine and full of sparkle
Close your eyes and see it glisten, Barnaby
Listen, Barnaby...
Put on your Sunday clothes
There's lots of world out there
Get out the brillantine and dime cigars
We're gonna find adventure in the evening air
Girls in white in a perfumed night
Where the lights are bright as the stars!
Put on your Sunday clothes, we're gonna ride through town
In one of those new horsedrawn open cars

[Cornelius & Barnaby:]
We'll see the shows at Delmonicos
And we'll close the town in a whirl
And we won't come until we've kissed a girl!

[Dolly:]
Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
That you feel as fine as you look!

[Dolly & Ambrose:]
Beneath your parasol, the world is all a smile
That makes you feel brand new down to your toes
